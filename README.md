FarmFresh is a mobile application designed to empower farmers by providing them direct access to markets, eliminating the need for intermediaries. Many farmers face challenges in selling their produce at fair prices due to their reliance on middlemen. FarmFresh bridges this gap by enabling farmers to connect directly with consumers and retailers through an easy-to-use platform. With features like produce listings, price negotiation, and transaction management, the app helps farmers showcase their products and increase their income potential. FarmFresh is optimized for rural areas with limited connectivity through offline functionality and lightweight design, ensuring that even those in remote locations can benefit from direct market access.
